            <h2 id="home">Welcome to My Tech Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I'm learning tech because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools for solving real-world problems
                and
                creating opportunities. Coming from Ghana, I've seen how access to technology can transform lives and
                communities. Becoming a full-stack web developer allows me to contribute meaningfully to that change
                while
                pursuing something I'm truly passionate about — building things that work, last, and make a difference.
            </p>

            <p>
                My inspiration to start learning web development came from a simple curiosity about how websites work
                and a
                desire to create something of my own. As I explored more, that curiosity turned into a goal: to master
                HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript, and eventually build dynamic, user-friendly web applications. Every line of code I
                write brings me closer to turning my ideas into reality and opening doors to new possibilities in tech.
